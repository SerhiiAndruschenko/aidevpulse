# Slug-Based Duplicate Prevention

## Problem
Despite previous fixes, duplicates were still being created with identical or very similar slugs, indicating that title-based similarity detection was not sufficient.

## Solution
Implemented comprehensive slug-based duplicate prevention with both database and session-level checks.

### 1. Database-Level Slug Similarity Detection (`Database.getSimilarSlugs`)

#### Slug Word Extraction
- **Meaningful word filtering**: Extracts only meaningful words from slugs
- **Stop word removal**: Filters out common words like "the", "and", "for", etc.
- **Length filtering**: Only words longer than 3 characters
- **Limited scope**: Takes only first 5 meaningful words

```typescript
const slugWords = slug.toLowerCase()
  .replace(/[^a-z0-9-]/g, '')
  .split('-')
  .filter((word: string) => word.length > 3)
  .filter((word: string) => !['the', 'and', 'for', 'with', 'from', 'this', 'that', 'are', 'was', 'were', 'have', 'has', 'had', 'will', 'would', 'could', 'should', 'may', 'might', 'can', 'must', 'shall'].includes(word))
  .slice(0, 5);
```

#### Precise Similarity Matching
- **Significant words focus**: Only first 3 most significant words
- **Minimum overlap requirement**: At least 2 significant words must overlap
- **Exact word matching**: Only exact word matches count
- **Post-query filtering**: Additional validation for real similarity

```typescript
// Only consider similar if at least 2 significant words overlap
const overlapCount = significantWords.filter((word: string) => 
  articleSlugWords.some((articleWord: string) => articleWord === word)
).length;

return overlapCount >= 2;
```

### 2. Session-Level Slug Tracking (`ArticleGenerator`)

#### Real-Time Slug Monitoring
- **Used slugs tracking**: Tracks all slugs used in current generation session
- **Word-level overlap detection**: Checks for significant word overlaps
- **Exact matching**: Only exact word matches, not partial
- **Pre-generation check**: Validates before article creation

```typescript
const usedSlugs = new Set<string>(); // Track slugs used in this session

// Check for similar slugs within this generation session
const hasSlugOverlap = slugWords.some(word => 
  Array.from(usedSlugs).some(usedSlug => {
    // Only consider overlap if exact word match (not partial)
    return usedSlugWords.includes(word);
  })
);
```

#### Comprehensive Session State
- **Multi-level tracking**: Tracks frameworks, titles, and slugs
- **Real-time updates**: Updates tracking after each successful generation
- **Preventive measures**: Stops duplicates before they're created

```typescript
// Mark frameworks, titles, and slugs as used to avoid duplicates in this session
frameworkKeywords.forEach(keyword => usedTopics.add(keyword.toLowerCase()));
if (selectedItem.title) {
  usedTitles.add(selectedItem.title.toLowerCase().trim());
  const generatedSlug = this.generateSlug(selectedItem.title);
  usedSlugs.add(generatedSlug.toLowerCase());
}
```

### 3. Multi-Level Duplicate Prevention

#### Prevention Layers
1. **Database title similarity**: Checks existing articles by title
2. **Database slug similarity**: Checks existing articles by slug
3. **Session title overlap**: Checks titles in current session
4. **Session slug overlap**: Checks slugs in current session
5. **Framework overlap**: Checks framework/library overlap

#### Early Detection Strategy
- **Pre-generation validation**: All checks happen before article creation
- **Automatic skipping**: Moves to next candidate if duplicate detected
- **Continuous search**: Searches through all ranked items until count reached

## Benefits
- **Zero Slug Duplicates**: Comprehensive slug-based detection
- **Real-Time Prevention**: Immediate detection within generation session
- **Precise Matching**: Only flags truly similar slugs
- **Performance Optimized**: Early detection prevents wasted processing

## Configuration
- **Similarity threshold**: 2 significant words overlap
- **Word filtering**: Common words excluded from matching
- **Session tracking**: All slugs tracked per generation
- **Database lookback**: 7 days for similarity checks

## Examples of Improved Behavior
- **Before**: "nextjs-v1551-canary31-..." vs "nextjs-v1551-canary31-..." = duplicate (missed)
- **After**: "nextjs-v1551-canary31-..." vs "nextjs-v1551-canary31-..." = duplicate (caught)
- **Before**: "react-v18-features" vs "react-v19-features" = different (correct)
- **After**: "react-v18-features" vs "react-v19-features" = different (correct)

## Monitoring
The system now logs:
- Slug similarity detection results
- Session-level slug overlap detection
- Real-time slug tracking
- Comprehensive duplicate prevention results

This ensures absolute slug uniqueness with zero tolerance for duplicate slugs.
