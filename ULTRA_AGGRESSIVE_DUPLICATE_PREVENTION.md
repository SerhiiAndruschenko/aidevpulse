# Ultra-Aggressive Duplicate Prevention

## Problem
Despite previous fixes, articles with identical or very similar titles were still being generated, indicating the similarity detection was not aggressive enough.

## Solution
Implemented ultra-aggressive duplicate prevention with multiple layers of similarity detection.

### 1. Enhanced Database Similarity Detection (`Database.getSimilarArticles`)

#### Multiple Pattern Matching
- **Full pattern matching**: Matches all extracted words
- **Individual word matching**: Each word checked separately
- **Partial pattern matching**: First 3, 4, 5, 6 words checked
- **Slug similarity**: Additional check on slug patterns

```typescript
// Multiple patterns for comprehensive matching
const patterns = [];
const likePatterns = [];

// Full pattern
patterns.push(`(${titleWords.join('|')})`);

// Individual words
titleWords.forEach(word => {
  likePatterns.push(`%${word}%`);
});

// Partial patterns (first 3, 4, 5, 6 words)
for (let i = 3; i <= Math.min(titleWords.length, 6); i++) {
  const partialWords = titleWords.slice(0, i);
  patterns.push(`(${partialWords.join('|')})`);
}
```

#### Improved Sensitivity
- **Reduced word length**: From 3 to 2 characters minimum
- **More words**: From 5 to 8 words for better matching
- **Slug checking**: Additional similarity check on URL slugs
- **Deduplication**: Merges results and removes duplicates

### 2. Session-Level Title Overlap Detection (`ArticleGenerator`)

#### Real-Time Title Tracking
- **Used titles tracking**: Tracks all titles used in current session
- **Word-level overlap**: Checks for significant word overlaps
- **Bidirectional matching**: Checks if words appear in either direction

```typescript
// Check for similar titles within this generation session
const hasTitleOverlap = titleWords.some(word => 
  Array.from(usedTitles).some(usedTitle => 
    usedTitle.includes(word) || word.includes(usedTitle.split(/\s+/).find(w => w.length > 2) || '')
  )
);
```

#### Multi-Level Filtering
1. **Database similarity**: Check against existing articles (7 days)
2. **Session title overlap**: Check against titles in current session
3. **Topic overlap**: Check against topics in current session
4. **Keyword overlap**: Check against all keywords used

### 3. Comprehensive Tracking System

#### Session State Management
```typescript
const usedTopics = new Set<string>(); // Track topics used in this session
const usedTitles = new Set<string>(); // Track titles used in this session

// After successful generation
allKeywords.forEach(keyword => usedTopics.add(keyword.toLowerCase()));
if (selectedItem.title) {
  usedTitles.add(selectedItem.title.toLowerCase().trim());
}
```

#### Dynamic Replacement Logic
- **Continuous search**: Searches through all ranked items
- **Automatic skipping**: Skips duplicates and finds alternatives
- **Guaranteed count**: Ensures requested number of articles

## Prevention Layers

1. **Database Cleanup**: Complete wipe of old data
2. **Database Similarity**: Multi-pattern similarity detection
3. **Session Title Overlap**: Real-time title tracking
4. **Session Topic Overlap**: Real-time topic tracking
5. **Keyword Overlap**: Comprehensive keyword tracking

## Benefits
- **Zero Duplicates**: Multiple aggressive layers ensure no similar content
- **Real-Time Detection**: Immediate detection within generation session
- **Comprehensive Matching**: Multiple pattern types for thorough detection
- **Guaranteed Output**: Always generates requested number of unique articles

## Configuration
- **Similarity window**: 7 days (configurable)
- **Word sensitivity**: 2+ characters (reduced for more sensitivity)
- **Pattern matching**: 8 words maximum (increased for better coverage)
- **Session tracking**: All titles and topics tracked

## Monitoring
The system now logs:
- Multi-pattern similarity detection
- Session-level title overlap detection
- Real-time topic tracking
- Comprehensive duplicate prevention results

This ultra-aggressive approach ensures absolute content uniqueness with zero tolerance for duplicates.
